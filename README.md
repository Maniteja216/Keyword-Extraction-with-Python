# Keyword-Extraction-with-Python

What is Keyword Extraction?
Keyword extraction is defined as the task of Natural language processing that automatically identifies a set of terms to describe the subject of the text. This is an important method in information retrieval (IR) systems: keywords simplify and speed up research. Keyword extraction can be used to reduce text dimensionality for further text analysis (subject modeling text classification)

The task of keyword extraction can be used in automatically indexing data, summarizing text, or generating tag clouds with the most representative keywords.
